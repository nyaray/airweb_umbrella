# Airweb.Umbrella

Starting the app is as easy as `(cd where/code/lives/airweb_umbrella; mix phx.server)`, if you've done the usual deps
fetching and building, see `mix help deps` for more information.

## Building

Building is rather easy:

```
# only the first time
mix deps.get
mix
```

## TODO

See the issues on GitHub for The Truthâ„¢. The next big-picture items are:

- [ ] moar(?) tests
- [ ] change internal representation of time from floats to 1/60ths
- [ ] deploy IRL, not just locally
- [ ] create a companion browser-extension that uses IRL-deployment
