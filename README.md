# Airweb.Umbrella

Starting the app is as easy as `(cd where/code/lives/airweb_umbrella; mix phx.server)`, if you've done the usual deps
fetching and building, see `mix help deps` for more information.

TODO

- [ ] moar tests
- [ ] deploy IRL, not just locally
- [ ] create a companion browser-extension that uses IRL-deployment
